      <h2>Repeat Infringers</h2>
      <p>
        It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or
        terminate the accounts of users who are determined to be repeat
        infringers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A repeat infringer is generally a user who has received multiple valid
        copyright infringement notices within a certain period, as determined at
        our discretion. We consider various factors, including the number and
        nature of notices and any counter-notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also reserve the right to take action in cases of serious copyright
        violations or fraudulent activities, even if a user does not strictly
        meet the repeat infringer threshold.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        GenArt AI Studio shall not be liable for any mistaken removal or failure
        to remove allegedly infringing content, provided that it acts in good
        faith in accordance with this policy. Users agree that GenArt AI Studio
        is not responsible for resolving copyright disputes and that such
        disputes should be addressed directly between the copyright holder and
        the alleged infringer.
