      <p>
        If you have downloaded any of our mobile software applications (each, an
        "App") from the Apple Inc. ("Apple") App Store or if you are using the
        App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
        and agree to the following notice regarding Apple. These Terms are
        between you and GenArt AI Studio only, not with Apple, and Apple is not
        responsible for the GenArt AI Studio Service and the content thereof.
        Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
        support services with respect to GenArt AI Studio. To the maximum extent
        permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation
        whatsoever with respect to GenArt AI Studio. Apple is not responsible
        for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to GenArt
        AI Studio or your possession or use of GenArt AI Studio, including: (1)
        product liability claims; (2) any claim that GenArt AI Studio fails to
        conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (3) claims
        arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and (4) claims
        with respect to intellectual property infringement. Apple is not
        responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of
        any third-party claim that GenArt AI Studio or your possession and use
        of the App infringe that third party's intellectual property rights. You
        agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using GenArt
        AI Studio. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party
        beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms,
        Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
        right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary
        of these Terms.
